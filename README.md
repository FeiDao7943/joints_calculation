# joints_calculation
> Welcome to joint-manipulator calculation. All these files are programming for the coursework

> Maybe this script still has some 'bug', but it can complete the drawing jobs of the coursework

> Changes that need to be made in the file `run_calculate.py` is in row 50~90 and arguement `--link_num`

There are 5 parameters need to define in common line. If the user wants to do all part of calculation with a 3-link manipulator, just need type:
`python run_calculate.py –link_num 3 --position --jacobian --velocity --torque ` in the command line. 
  
And if just want to calculate, and generate a figure, type: `python run_calculate.py –link_num 3` in the command line. All the result will be printed in the command line.

> **Not avaliable until 16:00 at 8th Dec, 2022 in U.K. time. The main script and files will be unseen before the coursework submited.**
